# e-commerce app

My e-commerce template app for practical purposes.
Generated from [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/cl4pper/react-boilerplate) :smiley:

1. **fork**/**clone** this repo
2. **npm i** (inside project root directory)
3. **npm run app** (to run project by webpack-dev-server)
4. **npm run stories** (to run components documentation)
5. **npm run style:fix** (to fix code style using prettier)
6. **npm run test / npm run test:watch** (to run tests once / constantly)

OBS: Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) installed in your
machine.
